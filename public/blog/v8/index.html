                example, if not for geeks, Firefox would never have started to
                catch on in 2004 and broken Internet Explorer’s reign. We
                installed Firefox on every non-geek’s computer we could find.
                And while we were there, we set everyone’s search engine to
                Google instead of Yahoo or MSN, and we made fun of their AOL
                email addresses until they switched to Gmail. Our preferences
                matter.”<br />

              <dt>ha</dt>
              <dd>
                A singular <em>ha</em> is the smallest amount of jocularity that
                retains the properties of laughter. It is the atomic level of
                laughing. Used infrequently to indicating grudging laughter,
                such as from an unfunny joke delivered by one’s employer, or
                when the typist is upset but forced to concede the source
                material is funny.
              </dd>
              <dt>heh</dt>
              <dd>
                Like the atomic <em>ha</em>, <em>heh</em> indicates the lowest
                levels of amusement, but unlike the frequently reluctant
                <em>ha</em>, <em>heh</em> indicates honest enjoyment, albeit a
                small amount.
              </dd>
              <dt>haha</dt>
              <dd>
                The most common form used, <em>haha</em> communicates that
                something is genuinely funny. It can be assumed that this is a
                quiet, inward enjoyment. If you could see the typist, they would
                likely be smiling, but not laughing out loud.
              </dd>
              <dt>hehe</dt>
              <dd>
                Similar to <em>haha</em>, <em>hehe</em> is used to indicate
                general amusement, though perhaps declining. Useful when a
                friend has been saying funny things for awhile, but the typist
                is losing interest and needs to get back to work.

              <dt>heehee</dt>
              <dd>
                Infrequently used by men, since it seems feminine. Primarily
                used in reaction to titillating source material or imitating
                schoolgirls.
              </dd>
              <dt>hahaha</dt>
              <dd>
                Used when a joke is unreservedly funny, often as an escalation
                from an earlier use of <em>haha</em> to indicate a greater level
                of enjoyment.
              </dd>
              <dt>hahahaha</dt>
              <dd>
                Anything over four ‘<em>ha</em>‘s is equivalent, and represents
                uncontrolled laughter, frequently audible.
              </dd>
              <dt>lol</dt>
              <dd>
                Although it technically stands for “laughing out loud,” use of
                <em>lol</em> frequently indicates the opposite. Due to early
                overuse on the internet, <em>lol</em> is now often used
                ironically, or as a general shorthand for mocking laughter.

              I’ve just finished reading the latest short book from the A Book
              Apart series. It’s called
              <em
                ><a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/design-is-a-job"
                  >Design is a Job</a
                ></em
              >, by Mike Monteiro. Mike is the owner of Mule Design, though if
              you’ve heard of him, it’s probably from his ascerbic twitter
              account, <a href="http://twitter.com/mike_ftw">@Mike_FTW</a>. Even
              more likely, you saw the video of a talk he gave about the
              importance of having a contract before you do any work, titled
              “Fuck You, Pay Me.” If you haven’t seen it, drop everything and
              <a href="http://vimeo.com/22053820">go watch it now</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              First thing first: If you’re already dismissing this review with
              “I don’t have time to read a book,” know that this book is only
              130 pages long. You can read it in just a few bus rides. It costs
              $18, or you can just come borrow the copy that’s on my desk. (I’m
              not kidding, please do borrow it, I’ll be thrilled you’re reading
              it.)
            </p>
            <p>
              Second thing: If you’re dismissing the book because you’re not a
              designer, you should know that this book isn’t really about
              design. It’s about how to be a professional in the design
              community. It is about how to interact with clients, and how to
              avoid getting burned when things go wrong. It’s about why clients
              behave the way they do, and what you can do to keep things going
              smoothly. It’s <em>aimed</em> at designers, but the lessons apply
              to everyone. I guarantee that everyone in the sales department
              will benefit from reading this book just as much as everyone in
              the development pit.
            </p>
            <p>Here’s a brief quote:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                I am tired of seeing you get your ass kicked because no one
                taught you better. I am tired of you not getting paid. I am
                tired of you working nights and weekends. I am tired of you
                doing spec work because someone has convinced you it will look
                good in your portfolio. I am tired of you sitting by and hoping
                the work sells itself.
              </p>
              <p>
                So I wrote you a book. It has a spine, and by the time you’re
                done reading, <strong>so will you</strong>.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>And another:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Companies love talking a studio out of the process that got them
                to hire them. Which is akin to signing Roy Halladay and then
                asking him to play the outfield. (Yes, it’s a baseball metaphor
                — I’ll walk you through it.) Roy Halladay is possibly the
                greatest pitcher of his generation. He’d be a terrible
                outfielder. But imagine some VP in the organization decided that
                since they’d just sunk a lot of money into signing him, they’d
                better get the most use out of him. So they should put him at a
                position that plays every day, instead of having him pitch.
                (Starting pitchers go once every five days.) In this metaphor
                baseball is standing in for design and the stupid VP is still
                the stupid VP.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              I cannot recommend this book strongly enough. It’s a quick read,
              and it’s funny. As you’ve no doubt noticed, Mike writes in a very
              conversational style, with a liberal sprinkling of curse words.
              The overall tone is that of a seasoned veteran sharing his
              hard-earned life lessons. Mike has made all the mistakes he writes
              about, and he wants to help you avoid them.
            </p>

              I just stumbled across a cache of notes for a blog post I never
              wrote. It was crammed full of funny things my then-three-year-old
              daughter was saying. Here they are for posterity’s sake.
            </p>
            <blockquote><p>“Mama, don’t whine.”</p></blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                “What are we gonna do today? We can go to the mall, or the zoo
                or OMSI. OMSI is a great place. OMSI even has bathrooms!”
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              There’s a note here that just reads “I smell like…” which was how
              Zoe announced that she smelled something for a long time. If I
              gave her a kiss after eating some candy, she’d say “I smell like
              chocolate.”
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                <strong>Zoe:</strong> “Tonight I’m going to dream about being a
                stop sign.”<br />
                <strong>Me:</strong> “What’s it like being a stop sign?”<br />
                <strong>Zoe:</strong> “Stopping people.”
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                “Santa has a gun in his pocket, so he can shoot down the chimney
                real fast.”
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                <strong>Zoe:</strong> “I want some chapstick, Momma!”<br />
                <strong>Annie:</strong> “Zoe, no, hang on, do you know what
                we’re doing right now?”<br />
                <strong>Zoe:</strong> “CHAPSTICK.”
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                “I want to play a game.”<br />
                [Uncle Sean turns on a card game on the ipad]<br />
                “No, I don’t <em>want</em> that game, that’s a
                <em>grown-up</em> game. I want to play
                <em>Plants versus Zombies</em>.”

              A couple weeks ago, I gathered my coworkers in the big conference
              room for a design critique. Instead of reviewing one of our own
              projects, however, I put up the websites for each of the current
              candidates for president. The process was fun, but also
              illuminating. It quickly became clear that in addition to overall
              aesthetics, political design carries its own set of
              considerations.
